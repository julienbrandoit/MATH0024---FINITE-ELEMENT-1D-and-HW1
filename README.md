# MODELING WITH PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS - Homework 1
# FINITE ELEMENT 1D

This repository contains the instructions and report I wrote for Assignment 1 of the MATH0024 course at the University of Li√®ge.

Most importantly, it also contains an implementation of the 1D finite element method. The python code is relatively modular and should be easy to adapt to other problems.
